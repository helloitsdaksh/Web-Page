              * Created a Deep Learning model for the classification of 38 types of different diseases in plants. The model I used is EfficientNetB0 which worked better than ResNetV250, approaching the accuracy of 98.79% for the detection of diseases in particular images of a leaf.
            
            **Neural-Network from Scratch**<br>
              * Built a Neural Network of 3 layers using NumPy and by coding all the equations from scratch. The accuracy achieved 84% on MNIST data.
            
            **Document-Enhancer** <br>
              * Document Enhancer is basically an Application that can be used to detect documents using Images as well as by capturing the image from the user's mobile camera, followed by taking part in a hackathon as a team where we were among the top 5 teams.
            
            **Digit-Recognizer**<br>
              * Created an app that detects handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using neural networks; the dataset used was mnist.npz, an official dataset provided by TensorFlow. The model is deployed on Heroku using a FLASK REST API.
